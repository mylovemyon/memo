## Usage
```
GNU bashbug, version 5.2.37-release
Usage: /usr/bin/bashbug [--help] [--version] [bug-report-email-address]

Bashbug is used to send mail to the Bash maintainers
for when Bash doesn't behave like you'd like, or expect.

Bashbug will start up your editor (as defined by the shell's
EDITOR environment variable) with a preformatted bug report
template for you to fill in. The report will be mailed to the
bug-bash mailing list by default. See the manual for details.

If you invoke bashbug by accident, just quit your editor without
saving any changes to the template, and no bug report will be sent.

SYNOPSIS

       bashbug [--help] [--version] [bug-report-email-addresses]

DESCRIPTION
       bashbug is a utility for reporting bugs in Bash to the maintainers.

       bashbug will start up your preferred editor with a preformatted bug report template for you to fill in. Save the file and quit the editor once you have completed the missing fields.  bashbug will notify you of any problems with
       the report and ask for confirmation before sending it. By default the bug report is mailed to both the GNU developers and the Debian Bash maintainers. The recipients can be changed by giving a comma separated list of
